## Overview and Origin
 

   Cadre was incorporated 2014 and founded by Ryan Williams. Ryan was inspired to create a system to track foreclosed homes after seeing the impact of foreclosures during a trip to Atlanta. By using data about properties and neighborhoods, he was able to start a business purchasing deeply undervalued homes and restoring them to occupancy. Cadre recieved its funding through venture capitalist firms, investemnt firms and real estate companies. Cadre has recieved a total of 800 million dollars in funding since 2014.

No other company in the industry has matched this record of recognition.

## Recommendations

I'd advise the company to venture out into a global scale and offer plain land. They would be able to cater to companies looking to build resorts or vacation home complex. This would cause them to utilize GIS Technology which allows people to compare the locations of different things in order to discover how they relate to each other.
